pytest-flask-example
====================

An example of developing pytest test for a fairly complex flask app


###During this step:

 + this git repo was initialized (README.md, .gitignore, LICENSE)
 + python modules flask and pytest were installed `pip install flask pytest`
 + requirements.txt was generated via `pip freeze > requirements.txt`
 + folder structure was laid out (./flask_app/ and ./tests/)
 + setup.cfg was created to configure the pytest module.
 + added \_\_init\_\_.py files to both new directories


###Coding Flow Guide:

1. Start at branch step_00
1. Develop new test
1. Commit new test
1. 'Increment step' by branching to step_01
1. Develop code
1. When all tests pass, commit code
1. 'Increment step' by branching to step_02
1. Update master branch to latest step
1. Repeat
